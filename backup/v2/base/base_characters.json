        "biography": "Full Name: Nevrish'aran'inrokini\n\nInformal Name: Harani\n\nRace: Chiss\n\nGender: Female\n\nAge: 32\n\n-Harani is from the planet Csaus, a part of the Chiss Ascendancy and base planet for the Inrokini family, the leaders of commerce for the Chiss people.\n\n-She was very creative, but with a sharp eye for detail. And a practical mind. A desire to combine beautiful form with precise function. She stepped into fashion design, creating lines of clothing that did just that.\n\n-Her other passion was learning about other cultures. It began as gathering inspiration for her work, traveling to places in the Ascendency where the other species under their rule lived. Though, they were few and far between, and far less developed civilizations than the Chiss. It was dangerous, and she used her wild expeditions as another opportunity to learn. Not only how to survive, but what attire and gear are necessary and best suited to more rugged living. She also used the resources on her home planet of Csaus to study all she could.\n\n-She became very successful in her line of work, a minor celebrity, being invited to special events, and to design clothing for some of the highest ranking Aristocra. It was around this time she began to develop an agenda. Growing more and more frustrated at seeing her people remain stubbornly isolationist and bogged down by their own in-fighting, and seeing another more open-minded of her kind get tossed into exile - Mitth’raw’nuruodo - she decided to use her shows as a platform for her new message of interspecies relations and anti-isolationism.\n\n-She was subtle in her message at first, but Chiss are known for their ability to pick up on subtle things. It grew into a scandal, and she was strongly advised to abandon her extremist views, lest her family suffer for it. And despite her distaste for some of her people’s ways, she was still very devoted to her family. Not wanting to risk their honor, she fell back in line.\n\nBut she was not content to stay that way.\n\n-In her Indiana Jones adventures in Chiss Space, Harani landed on a planet, where she went exploring, and discovered some ancient ruins, that turned out to belong to the old Sith Empire.\n\n-She found more and more, collecting them and trying to study this culture she knew nothing about, utterly fascinated.\n\n-After leaving Chiss space for good, she learned that there was a new Empire in town, and was fascinated to learn more about them.\n\n-Knowing that she’d never be happy in the Ascendancy, and that her line would be stronger without her on the verge of spouting more unpatriotic rants, she decided to leave. She conspired with a few trusted family members. If she just up and left, they risked a scandal. So they faked her death. The official story was that she went on another expedition in the wilds to prepare for her next line of wilderness gear. And the wilds claimed her.\n\n-She utilized a series of interplanetary flights, until meeting up with an underground group with whom she’d arranged to be smuggled out of the Ascendancy for an incredibly hefty sum. She hid aboard a large ship which was headed to a mining operation on one of the Rim worlds. And from there she and another Chiss ‘borrowed’ a small freighter, and she was delivered out of the Unknown Regions.\n\n-She was able to sell her old Sith Empire pieces to an obsessive Moff collector, who also agreed to enlighten her about the new Empire. At first she was excited about this. And the Moff was very fond of her, being a strange and unique piece unto herself.\n\n-She went on more expeditions to find more old relics, mostly for the Moff, but she also dealt to other private collectors, including a Hutt. The Moff even got her a couple of contracts with the Imperial Reclamation Service, when he didn’t explicitly want to keep anything for himself.\n\n-As she did this, she began to learn that the grandness the Moff had presented to her was not true, especially in regards to their race relations, a brand of xenophobia that included violence and segregation. Worse than her own people.\n\n-She broke ties with the Moff, taking her latest haul with her, that he was expecting her to bring. The items were from a vacuum-sealed vault. It contained a couple of old Sith banners, a Sith Lord’s mantle (with no note of who it belonged to), a couple of unpowered data cubes, and a jewel-encrusted claw that may have belonged to a Krayt Dragon.\n\n-The Moff put a bounty on her, preferred alive. She learned of this after narrowly escaping a bounty hunter’s attack.\n\n-She’s given up on the Empire now, but cannot go back to her home. Homeless, friendless, and with little reputation, she clings to the fringes, exploring the Outer Rim, trying to avoid the law and anyone she can’t trust… which is, well…. everyone.",
