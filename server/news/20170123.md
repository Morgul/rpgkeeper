The project has sat by the wayside for the past 8 months or so, while I've focused on other endeavours. My gaming groups
dried up, for the most part, and only recently have started to pick back up. So, it's only just recently that I've
started working on RPGKeeper again. But, I haven't been idle this whole time; I've been learning new skills and
technologies that should make "RPGKeeper great again." (_I couldn't resist._)

## Technical Details

For the tech-savy among you, I've upgraded to [VueJS 2.X], and [Material Design] thanks to the [vue-material] project. I
also went back to Google based logins; it's so much less of a headache for me than having to have local based logins.
Even for the users, it's more convenient, since Google remembers your login and auto-signs you in. So, all around, this
is the best way to move forward, IMHO. I may expand and also offer Facebook and Twitter logins, but that's down the road.

### Going back to RethinkDB

The original v2.0.0 beta was built on [RethinkDB]. I loved it as a database, unfortunately, it was difficult to work to
get setup developing against. Fast forward two years, and now [Docker] has made that sort of thing easy. It's trivially
available for all platforms, no running in a VM, and everything just works right out of the box. Because of that, I've
decided to go back to my favorite database, and not continue on the codebase I've written. There's less chance for failure,
and less reason to think there's a critical bug that will make us lose your data.

#### Isn't RethinkDB dead?

To paraphrase Mark Twain: 'the rumors of RethinkDB's death have been greatly exaggerated.' Yes, the startup that built
Rethink has filed for bankruptcy. That is, in fact, a sad blow to the RethinkDB community. But, RethinkDB is still being
developed, and they're currently looking for an open-source foundation to keep everything going. I'm both showing my
support by continuing to use it, and watching to see which way the wind blows. If it dies, chances are I can stay on the
latest version for quite a lone time before making a switch. I'll evaluate options when it comes to that; it's all JSON
anyway, so migration shouldn't be hard.

## Moving Forward

Moving forward, I'm going to complete the base rewrite. Then, I'm going to port over the old 'Edge of the Empire' system,
so that I can finally replace the aging version out on [rpgkeeper.com](http://rpgkeeper.com). Once that is done, I will
be working on adding in the [FATE] system (currently playing a game in it) and the [Risus] system (very simple). I'll then
add campaign support, and start working on adding in D&D 5e. That's the rough timeline.
