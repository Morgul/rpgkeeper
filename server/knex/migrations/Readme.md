# Knex Migrations

---

**DO NOT CONVERT THESE TO TYPESCRIPT**

_Currently, knex does not support migrations in typescript files; some tooling needs to be done to point it at the
generated javascript files._

These are the knex migration files. Whenever we need to change the database, those changes need to be captured in a
migration. In order to read more on creating these migrations using the `knex` command line utility, please see the
[documentation][knex]
